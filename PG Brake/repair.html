            <p class="text-2">One is more expensive than the other!</p>
            <p class="upper">	To make sure you car is going to stay reliable and make your car last longer, preventative maintenance will help. There might be some increased costs in the beginning, but in the long run, you will ensure your car is more efficient, more reliable, and will cost less to repair. Repairs, on the other hand, are when you need to replace or fix something that suddendly stopped working. Repairs are inevidable, and can often be costly. The average cost of replacing a car's engine often ranges from $2,000 to $4,000! This is why regular maintenance is key. When your car is maintained regularly, such as having oil changed every 3,000 miles, or topping off your fluids every few months, you can prevent unnecessary repair costs. Make sure to bring your car in to our shop early before it's too late.</p>
            
<p class="upper">	We repair all common and uncommon makes and models in the United States, ranging from Acuras and Chevys to cars like Daewoos and Fiats!</p>

            <p class="upper p5">Sometimes, your car breaks down. It's a part of life.

Here at PG Brake, we don't charge you an arm or a leg for huge repairs. </p>

                	<a><b>ALIGNMENTS</b></a>
                    <p class="upper">Sometimes, your car's wheels might get a bit misaligned. This affects steering, and if not caught early, can lead to very expensive repairs. Also, getting your wheels balanced will lead to less wear-and-tear on the vehicle's tires, and allows for more straight driving, instead of the car pulling to one side often. We have a dedicated bay and machine just for alignments, and we can do most cars. So call in and schedule your alignment today!</p>
